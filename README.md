# Arbitrary precision arithmetic library

Light arbitrary-precision arithmetic library. It allows to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) and bitwise operations (NEG, OR, AND, XOR) on signed numbers. Tested on random numbers based on Python arithmetic.

### TODO
- bitwise operations
- fix error handling
- unit tests, CI
